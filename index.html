            <p>Once there lived two loving brothers who were called kwarteng and Alvin.Kwarteng was the 
            elderly brother.Kwarteng was older than Alvin four good years.unfortunately they were orphans.the
            only property their father left behind was a house and his big farm.Kwarteng the elderly
            brother saw the property to be too small to share with his younger brother who is Alvin 
            so he wanted to kill Alvin so that all the property will now be his.One day he prepared Alvin 
            favourite meal and poisened it.Alvin was outside busy watching two dogs fighting.Kwarteng called
            Alvin to come take his food.Alvin very excited took his food outside to eat.He came inside to
            wash his hand he rushed to go and eat his delicious meal and saw that the two dogs which
            he was busy watching them fighting had poured his delicious meal away.He was very angry at the 
            dogs for pouring his food away.He seperated the dogs and went inside to watch television.Kwarteng
            was very suprised why Alvin is still alive because he poisened him.He went straight to Alvin and 
            asked why didnt you eat the food.Alvin said i sent the food outside to eat but some dogs poured
            it away.Kwarteng got angry than even Alvin because his plan did not work.Kwarteng went to a spiritualist
            to kill Alvin spiritually.The spiritualist said i cant kill him he is very prayerful and kind unless you kill
            him physically but even that it would not be easy.The second plan of Kwarteng was to burn kwarteng
            alive.Kwarteng told Alvin that the is not food in the house so they should go to farm or else they 
            will starve.Alvin the obedient boy said okay no problem i will go to farm with you.When they got to
            farm they worked for about three to four hours.Alvin said he is tired so they should rest.They had a
            a small room made with bamboo and clay in the farm.They both went in side to sleep when they were 
            sleeping Kwarteng went out of the room silently  he set the house on fire and ran and went home.He was very 
            happy that his plan had work this time.Not knowing Alvin went out of his room to go and harvest 
            some yam and maize.When Alvin was done harvesting the yam and maize he was now looking for Kwarteng
            he went to the small house to look for him and saw that the house they had in the farm was burnt
            he thought that Alvin was burnt because Alvin was inside his room when he went to harvest the yam
            and maize.He knelt down and began to weep.he cried till he got to house just to see Kwarteng happy
            watching television.Kwarteng was very suprised to see Alvin alive.Alvin was also shocked to see 
            kwarteng alive.When Kwarteng saw Alvin crying seriously.He saw the love Alvin had for him.He told
            Alvin all the evil he planed for him and also asked for forgiveness.Because Alvin had a good heart 
            he forgave him.The people in the community began to love the relationship
            between the two brothers.</p>
